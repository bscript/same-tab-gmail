# Gmail Same-Tab Switcher

A lightweight Chrome extension that tries to make Gmail account switching reuse the same tab instead of opening a new one.

---

## Features

- Reuse the same Gmail tab when switching accounts.
- Minimal permissions required.
- Works for the most common Gmail account-switch URLs (`https://mail.google.com/mail/u/*`).
- Intercepts both JS-triggered new tabs and standard anchor clicks.
